# Modified-Early-Warning-Score
Python code for Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) in actual condition. The MEWS is a scoring system used in healthcare to identify patients who are at risk of deteriorating or experiencing a medical emergency.
You can modify the values of the vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, body temperature, and level of consciousness) to calculate the MEWS score for different patients. Remember to adapt the score thresholds and rules based on the specific guidelines or protocols followed in your healthcare setting.

Please note that this code only calculates the MEWS score based on the provided vital signs. In a real-world scenario, additional factors and assessments may be considered while determining the overall patient condition. It's always recommended to consult medical professionals and follow established protocols for accurate evaluation.
